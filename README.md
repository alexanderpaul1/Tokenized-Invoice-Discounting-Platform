# Tokenized Invoice Discounting Platform

## Overview

This Tokenized Invoice Discounting Platform is a blockchain-based solution that transforms traditional invoice financing into a transparent, efficient, and accessible digital marketplace. By tokenizing accounts receivable, the platform enables businesses to unlock working capital quickly while providing investors with access to a new class of short-term investment opportunities.

## Core Components

The platform consists of four primary smart contracts:

1. **Invoice Verification Contract**
    - Validates the legitimacy of business receivables
    - Performs digital signature verification
    - Cross-references with registered business entities
    - Stores immutable invoice details including issuer, recipient, amount, and due date
    - Prevents duplicate invoice submissions

2. **Risk Assessment Contract**
    - Evaluates payment likelihood and timeframes
    - Implements algorithmic credit scoring models
    - Analyzes historical payment data between counterparties
    - Assigns risk ratings and suggested discount rates
    - Provides transparent risk metrics to potential investors

3. **Tokenization Contract**
    - Converts verified receivables into tradable digital assets
    - Mints ERC-721 NFTs representing invoice ownership
    - Manages fractional ownership through ERC-20 tokens
    - Implements compliant transfer mechanisms
    - Handles invoice bundling for diversification

4. **Payment Tracking Contract**
    - Monitors settlement of underlying invoices
    - Manages escrow of funds during settlement periods
    - Distributes payments to token holders proportionally
    - Records payment histories to inform risk models
    - Handles default scenarios and recovery processes

## Key Benefits

### For Businesses:
- **Improved Cash Flow**: Convert receivables to immediate working capital
- **Competitive Rates**: Market-based pricing creates fair discount rates
- **Simplified Process**: Streamlined digital verification and funding
- **No Debt**: Off-balance sheet financing without creating new liabilities
- **Scalability**: Finance individual invoices or entire portfolios

### For Investors:
- **New Asset Class**: Access to short-term, secured investment opportunities
- **Portfolio Diversification**: Invest across multiple industries and risk profiles
- **Transparent Risk Assessment**: Clear visibility into investment quality
- **Automated Returns**: Smart contract-enforced payment distributions
- **Fractional Investment**: Participate with minimal capital requirements

## Technical Architecture

The platform is built on Ethereum with:
- Solidity smart contracts for core business logic
- Layer 2 scaling solution for reduced transaction costs
- IPFS for secure, decentralized document storage
- Oracle integration for real-world data verification
- Web3 frontend for intuitive user experience

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- Hardhat development environment
- MetaMask or compatible Ethereum wallet
- Infura or Alchemy API keys for network access

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/invoice-discounting-platform.git
cd invoice-discounting-platform

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

### Configuration

1. Set up your `.env` file with network endpoints and API keys
2. Configure risk assessment parameters in `config/risk-parameters.json`
3. Set up KYC/AML verification integrations for regulatory compliance

## Usage Examples

### Submitting an Invoice for Tokenization

```javascript
const InvoiceVerification = artifacts.require("InvoiceVerification");
const ipfsHash = "QmW2WQi7j6c7UgJTarActp7tDNikE4B2qXtFCfLPdsgaTQ";

module.exports = async function(callback) {
  const verification = await InvoiceVerification.deployed();
  
  await verification.submitInvoice(
    "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890", // Payer address
    ethers.utils.parseEther("10000"), // Invoice amount
    1652918400, // Due date (Unix timestamp)
    ipfsHash, // IPFS reference to invoice document
    "INV-2025-04-001" // Invoice reference number
  );
  
  console.log("Invoice submitted successfully");
  callback();
};
```

### Investing in a Tokenized Invoice

```javascript
const InvoiceToken = artifacts.require("InvoiceToken");

module.exports = async function(callback) {
  const tokenContract = await InvoiceToken.deployed();
  const invoiceId = 1; // ID from verification process
  
  // Purchase 25% of the tokenized invoice
  await tokenContract.investInInvoice(
    invoiceId,
    25, // Percentage to purchase
    { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.05") } // Investment amount with discount
  );
  
  console.log("Investment completed successfully");
  callback();
};
```
